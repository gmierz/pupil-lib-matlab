Scripts
--------

This folder contains some scripts that can be used as examples to how the
data is processed and used. It is not clean but gives you a sense of how
the data should be processed. Spoiler...it is very easy! :)

#~pupilviewer_avgepoch~# is the main script containing most of the code that
has ever been used for an analysis.
